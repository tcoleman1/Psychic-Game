# Psychic-Game
App randomly chooses a letter and the user has to guess which letter was chosen.
Wins equates to the number of times the user has guessed the letter correctly.
Losses equated to the number of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses.
The amount of guesses left will update after each guess.
Once the player wins the game will start over, and similarly if the player has loss.
